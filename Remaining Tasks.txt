Remaining Tasks

User Input Validation and Exception/Error Checking
1. Refuse to accept negative or alphanumeric values in the Add Food menu
2. Check for required formatting of input rules (right now there are exceptions if they don't type in the rule perfectly)
3. Be able to remove a rule one at a time instead of clearing all at once

Commenting and Organization
1. Main method has stuff all over the place
2. Javadocs and algorithm explanation comments
3. Rename MealSummary static helper class to something else (easy REFACTOR in eclipse)

BP Tree
1. Need independent functionality of BP Tree so that it passes JUnit Tests
2. Utilize BP tree to obtain the filtered nutrients (integrate BP tree into project)

Checking with TA's in Lab
1. Identify potential areas where we would be losing points from the same people who will be grading this.
